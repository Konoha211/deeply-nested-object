Rui

What I want to record is summer, not specifically that season, but the kind of fleeting joy that can only be felt in summer and cherished only after it is gone.
Lying on the apartment couch eating ice cream
Tidying up the room while playing loud music
Skating down the road in the middle of the night with friends
A party I decided to go to on the spur of the moment
